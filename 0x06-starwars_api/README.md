# 0x06. Star Wars API

This project fetches and displays character names from the Star Wars API (SWAPI) based on a movie ID.

## Description

Given a movie ID as a command-line argument, the script retrieves all character URLs associated with the movie from SWAPI, then makes additional requests to fetch and print each character's name in the order they appear.

## Usage

```bash
./0-starwars_characters.js <movie_id>
